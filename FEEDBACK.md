# Feedback

1. Your team: GCU_CS
2. Name of each individual participating: Kyungchan Im and Gabriel Teixeira Lima Aracena
3. How many unit tests were you able to pass? 13
4. Document and describe any enhancements included to help the judges properly grade your submission.
    - We created a new function in the simple_data_tool.py file to map the regional disaster type. We saw the definitions of the region on top of the page that were not being utilized to we thought it would be a good idea to use it for something.
    - We created a new function in the simple_data_tool.py file to map the regional total claim. We wanted to do further data analysis project for this competition, so we added extra function that we needed to calculate.
    - We then created a jupyter notabook that enables the visualization of that data and implements some data analysis to our dataset. We initially thought about creating a neural network and implementing a deep learning program but the dataset is too small for that. 
    - We implemented a REST API in the application.py file that can be used to interact and access the data. We used it locally but one could use Postman to interact with it (that's what's more common in the industry)


5. Any feedback for the coding competition? Things you would like to see in future events?
We had a lot of fun completing it! I just think the project itself would be more descriptive, it took us the first hour just to understand what we were supposed to accomplish.
